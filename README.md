# Website!!!
A website that I made

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a place where I could place my projects and to show off some programming for my job search. I wanted to use GitHub Pages
because it provides a hosting environment that is easy to use. For that reason, I was restricted to using only HTML and CSS which is not my preferred method,
but works for this application.

I will be uploading all my projects, academic and person here for the remaining time.
